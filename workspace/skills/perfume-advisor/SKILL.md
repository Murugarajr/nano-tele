# Perfume Advisor — Collection & Selection Rules

This skill contains the owner's perfume collection and the algorithm for selecting the best perfume based on weather and occasion. The main agent handles weather retrieval via `exec` with `curl`. This skill provides the data and logic only.

Always recommend ONLY from the collection below. Never suggest perfumes outside this list.
Always choose exactly one perfume by name. Never give a generic scent-family-only recommendation.
Always present temperatures in °C. Convert if needed.

## Strict Selection Algorithm

### Step 0 — Check Recent Recommendations

BEFORE selecting a perfume, read `workspace/memory/RECENT_PICKS.md` to check:
1. **What was recommended yesterday for the SAME city and SAME weather bucket**
2. **What was recommended yesterday** regardless of city or weather (global consecutive day rule)

### Step 1 — Determine Weather Bucket

From temperature and humidity:
- `Hot & dry`: `>25°C` and `<50%`
- `Hot & humid`: `>25°C` and `>=50%`
- `Mild`: `15-25°C`
- `Cool & dry`: `10-15°C` and `<60%`
- `Cold & dry`: `<10°C` and `<60%`
- `Cold & rainy/wet`: `<15°C` and `>=60%`

### Step 2 — Infer Occasion

From the prompt or time:
- `office`, `work`, `meeting` → office
- `date`, `date night`, `dinner`, `party`, `night out` → evening
- Before 17:00 → daytime
- 17:00 or later → evening

### Step 3 — Build Candidate List

Filter to perfumes whose `Best Weather` matches the weather bucket, then apply the ranked priority list for the inferred occasion.

### Step 4 — Apply Rotation Rules

**Rule A — Same City + Same Weather Rotation:**
If the top-ranked perfume was recommended YESTERDAY for the SAME city AND SAME weather bucket, SKIP it and pick the NEXT perfume in the ranked list.

*Example: If "Sauvage" was picked yesterday for London (Mild), don't pick it today for London (Mild) — but it's OK for Sheffield (Mild).*

**Rule B — Global Consecutive Day Rule:**
Regardless of city or weather, if a perfume was recommended YESTERDAY (any city, any weather bucket), do NOT recommend it today. Skip to the next eligible perfume.

*Example: If "Sauvage" was picked yesterday for ANY city, don't pick it today for ANY city.*

**Rule C — Similar Scent Family Fallback:**
If both Rule A and Rule B eliminate the top candidates, prioritize perfumes with the **same scent family** as the skipped perfume(s). Similar families:
- Citrus group: Citrus Aquatic, Citrus Fruity Oriental, Citrus Aromatic
- Woody group: Woody Fresh, Aromatic Woody, Aquatic Woody, Oriental Woody, Fruity Woody, Amber Woody Vetiver
- Gourmand group: Amber Gourmand, Oriental Gourmand
- Fresh/Aquatic group: Fresh Aquatic, Marine Aromatic

### Step 5 — Select Final Perfume

Pick the first eligible perfume from the ranked list after applying all rotation rules.

### Step 6 — Log the Recommendation

After making a recommendation, append to `workspace/memory/RECENT_PICKS.md`:
```
| YYYY-MM-DD | [City Name] | [Weather Bucket] | [Occasion] | [Perfume Name] |
```

### Step 7 — Validation

If weather data is partial but enough to choose a bucket, make the recommendation.
